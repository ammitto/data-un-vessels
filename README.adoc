== Directory Structure

```

├── downloaded/        # Raw downloaded files (PDF)
├── processed/         # Processed YAML files (one per vessel)
├── reference-docs/    # Reference documentation and converted HTML
└── README.adoc        # This file
```

== Data Format

Each processed vessel is stored as a YAML file with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
id: un-vessel-7303803
entity_type: vessel
names:
  - full_name: AN SAN 1
    is_primary: true
imo_number: '7303803'
date_designated: 30-Mar-18
----

== Processing

The source PDF must be converted to HTML before running the parser script.

=== Converting PDF to HTML

Install `poppler-utils` (for `pdftohtml`) or use an online converter:

[source,shell]
----
# Using poppler-utils (macOS)
brew install poppler

# Convert PDF to HTML
pdftohtml -c -noframes reference-docs/1718_designated_vessels_list_final.pdf reference-docs/1718_designated_vessels_list_final.html
----

=== Running the Parser

After conversion, run the parser from the ammitto gem root:

[source,shell]
----
bundle exec ruby scripts/parse_un_vessels_list.rb
----

This will generate YAML files in the `processed/` directory.

== Important Note

Vessels frequently change names and flags. The **IMO number** is the primary
unique identifier and should be used for matching.

== Usage

This data is part of the https://github.com/ammitto/ammitto[Ammitto] sanctions
screening system.
